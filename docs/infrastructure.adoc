== Infrastructure

All of the infrastructure that is deployed to Azure, is done using Terraform. The templates have been configured so that different options can be deployed depending on requirements.

=== Architecture Overview

The Terraform stack combines Ensono Stacks modules with local modules and data sources. The diagram below shows the module relationships.

The following diagram depicts the resources that are deployed.

NOTE: The diagram shown is generated from a prototype diagram as configuration so may not be 100% accurate yet.

The deployment of the resources is performed using the Ensono Digital AKS module as found in the https://github.com/amido/stacks-terraform[Stacks Terraform] repository.

=== Terraform Outputs

A number of outputs from Terraform are required in other parts of the pipeline, for example when deploying Helm charts to the cluster.

A new PowerShell cmdlet has been created called `Set-EnvironmentVars` which allows any JSON string to be passed and for it to be interpreted and the name and value to be turned into environment variables. The option to pass the date through is also available so that a simple key value pair is passed along the pipeline.

The following code snippet shows how the outputs from Terraform can be turned into prefixed environment variables.

.Extracting Terraform outputs
[source,powershell,linenums]
----
# This command is run from the root of the repository
Invoke-Terraform -Output -Path deploy/terraform | `
    Set-EnvironmentVars -prefix "TFOUT" -key "value" -passthru | `
    ConvertTo-Yaml | `
    Out-File -Path inspec_inputs.yml
----

As can be seen from the example above, this command has four parts to the pipeline.

. Get the outputs from Terraform as a JSON string.
* Under the hood the `Invoke-Terraform` calls the Terraform command and retrieves the output as JSON
. Create environment variables from each of the names of the outputs in the JSON. Prefix these names with `TFOUT`. As the data from Terraform can be nested, the `-key` parameter informs the cmdlet which nested parameter holds the value. Also pass an array of data through the pipeline.
. Convert the array to a YAML string
. Write the the YAML string to a file to be used for the infrastructure tests

=== Outputs Reference

Key outputs used across the pipeline include:

* `resource_group_name`
* `aks_cluster_name`
* `aks_ingress_public_ip`
* `app_gateway_public_ip_name`
* `dns_base_domain`

=== Data Sources and Azure API Dependencies

Data sources are used to fetch resource IDs, DNS zones, and version information. Ensure the service principal has read permissions in the relevant resource groups and subscriptions.

=== Workspace Strategy

Terraform workspaces are aligned with environment names. The workspace is selected or created during `infra:init` using the `TF_VAR_stage` value.

=== AKS Deployment Details

The AKS cluster deployment process follows these key steps:

**Cluster Provisioning**:

. Resource group creation in specified Azure region
. Virtual network and subnets configured for AKS
. Network Security Groups (NSGs) with Azure Policy enforcement
. AKS cluster creation with specified Kubernetes version
. Node pools configured with auto-scaling rules
. Managed identity binding for Azure RBAC

**Networking Configuration**:

. Public or private API server endpoint (configurable)
. Application Gateway for ingress traffic management
. Azure Load Balancer for service networking
. DNS integration with public and private zones
. Network Policy enforcement (Calico/Azure CNI)

**Security Context**:

. Pod security policies enforced at cluster level
. Network policies restrict traffic between pods
. Azure RBAC controls access to cluster resources
. Service principals with minimal required permissions
. Managed identities for workload authentication

=== Application Gateway SSL Configuration

SSL/TLS termination is handled by Application Gateway with the following architecture:

**Certificate Management**:

. Certificates stored in Azure Key Vault
. TLS policies configured for Application Gateway
. Supported protocols: TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3
. Cipher suites configured per security standards
. Certificate rotation managed via certificate provider

**Configuration Flow**:

. Terraform creates Application Gateway with HTTPS listener
. Certificate is retrieved from Key Vault during deployment
. Helm values template injects gateway IP into ingress configuration
. External DNS synchronizes ingress hostnames to DNS zones
. Traffic flows: Client → Application Gateway (SSL termination) → Ingress Controller → Services
