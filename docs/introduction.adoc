== Introduction

When using the .NET and Java workloads of {company} Stacks, it is expected that the applications will be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster. Whilst the ethos behind Stacks is to allow people to use it in whatever way they need, the AKS Infrastructure will deploy a Kubernetes cluster with, optionally, a number of applications using Helm.

This cluster can then be used to deploy any number of workloads, including our .NET and Java Web APIs as well as front end applications and data workers.
